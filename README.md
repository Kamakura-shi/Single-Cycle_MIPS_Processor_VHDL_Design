Datapath Design (FPGA): Built a step-by-step MIPS processor (PC, ALU, registers, control unit) and implemented it on FPGA using Verilog for CPU architecture understanding

Instruction Execution (Firmware): Gained low-level insight into machine code execution (fetch-decode-execute) relevant to embedded systems and firmware development
